		<p>Ninoy Aquino (1967-1983): As a senator and prominent opposition figure during the Marcos regime, Ninoy was instrumental in rallying public opposition to the dictatorship. He was imprisoned for several years before being exiled to the United States. Upon his return to the Philippines in 1983, he was assassinated, which further galvanized public opposition to Marcos.</p>
		<p>Corazon Aquino (1986-1992): As the first female President of the Philippines, Corazon (or "Cory") oversaw the country's transition to democracy following the People Power Revolution in 1986.

			<p>Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III (2010-2016): During his presidency, Noynoy focused on addressing corruption and promoting transparency in government.

		<p>Political dynastism, Some critics argue that the Aquino family's continued influence in Philippine politics perpetuates political dynasties, which is a major problem in Philippine politics. They argue that the family's political power has prevented other qualified candidates from running for public office. Inaction on systemic problems, Critics argue that despite the Aquino family's contributions to Philippine democracy, they have not done enough to address the country's systemic problems, including poverty, inequality, and corruption. Lack of progress on major issues, During Noynoy Aquino's presidency, some critics argued that his administration did not do enough to address certain issues, such as improving public transportation, reducing crime rates, and creating more job opportunities. Failure to hold accountable past human rights violators, Some critics have also accused the Aquino family of failing to hold accountable past human rights violators, particularly those who were responsible for the atrocities committed during the Marcos regime. The Aquino family has been identified with the restoration of democracy in the Philippines following the tyranny of Ferdinand Marcos. Corruption is defined as the abuse of power for personal benefit, which frequently results in resource misallocation and the erosion of public confidence. Some members of the Aquino family have been implicated in corruption claims, which have harmed their image. Human rights are the fundamental rights and liberties to which all human beings are entitled, including the right to life, liberty, and security. The Aquino family has been accused of failing to redress human rights violations committed under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Natural disasters are phenomena that have disastrous consequences on communities, such as typhoons, earthquakes, and floods. The government's reaction to natural catastrophes was criticized under Noynoy Aquino's administration for being weak and delayed. The practice of administering a country or an organization in an open, responsible, and successful manner is referred to as good governance. The Aquino family has long been linked with good governance, with several members well-known for their efforts to enhance government openness and accountability.</p>
